    Provider or client admin adds clients (as users).

🔹 Suggested UI Development Order
1️⃣ Admin Dashboard (Start Here 🚀)

Why?

    The Admin Panel is essential for managing subscriptions, providers, and servicemen.
    It enables you to control the system while testing real data.
    Core features like subscriptions, user management, and organisation types are handled here.

Key Features to Build First: ✅ Admin Login & Authentication
✅ Create & Manage Subscription Plans
✅ Approve/Reject Providers (if applicable)
✅ View & Manage Organisations & Users
✅ Monitor Bookings & Platform Analytics
2️⃣ Provider Dashboard (Next 🏗️)

Why?

    Providers cannot operate without admin-created subscriptions and platform settings.
    This is where providers onboard clients, servicemen, and organisations.

Key Features to Build: ✅ Provider Registration & Subscription Selection
✅ White-Label Customization (if applicable)
✅ Add & Manage Servicemen
✅ Create & Manage Organisations & Branches
✅ Assign Jobs to Servicemen
✅ View Earnings & Reports
3️⃣ Client Interface (Last 🎯)

Why?

    Clients need organisations, servicemen, and booking functionality to be available first.
    The platform must be populated with service providers before clients can book services.

Key Features to Build: ✅ Client Registration & Login
✅ Book Services (Without Selecting Serviceman)
✅ View Assigned Serviceman & Booking Status
✅ Payment Processing (if required)
✅ Client Admin Panel (for managing bookings & clients under an organisation)
🔹 Summary of UI Development Order
Step	Interface	Why?
1️⃣ First	Admin Dashboard	Manages subscriptions, providers, and core platform settings.
2️⃣ Second	Provider Dashboard	Enables providers to onboard clients & servicemen.
3️⃣ Last	Client Interface	Allows clients to book services once everything else is set up.

    Move to Provider Dashboard (User onboarding, servicemen management, job assignments).
    Finish with the Client UI (Bookings, payments, notifications).

🔹 Recommended Tech Stack for UI
1️⃣ Frontend Frameworks
Framework	Pros	Ideal For
React.js (⚡ Recommended)	Fast, component-based, large ecosystem (Next.js, Tailwind CSS)	Scalable dashboards, SPAs
Next.js	SEO-friendly, built-in routing, performance boost	Provider & Client portals
Vue.js	Simpler than React, great state management	If you prefer Vue over React
Angular	Strong for enterprise apps but heavy	Admin dashboards, complex UIs
2️⃣ UI Libraries for Faster Development
UI Library	Why Use It?
ShadCN (React/Tailwind)	Modern, customizable, lightweight components
Material UI	Google Material Design, ready-to-use components
Ant Design	Great for admin dashboards, enterprise look
Tailwind CSS	Highly customizable, perfect for branding & white-labeling

🔹 Suggested Tech Stack:
✅ React + Next.js (or Vue if preferred)
✅ Tailwind CSS + ShadCN for styling
✅ Redux or Zustand for state management
🔹 UI Structure & Pages
1️⃣ Admin Dashboard (Super Admin)

    Login Page
    Dashboard Overview (KPIs, Revenue, Users, Bookings)
    Manage Providers (Create, Update, Suspend)
    Manage Subscriptions (Create, Update, Expiry Handling)
    Manage Organisation Types
    Monitor Transactions & Commissions
    Platform Settings

💡 Design Tip:

    Use Ant Design or Material UI for a structured dashboard.
    Sidebar navigation for quick access to sections.

2️⃣ Provider Dashboard

    Login Page

    White-Label Setup (Logo, Colors, Domain)
    Manage Organisations & Branches
    Onboard & Manage Servicemen

🔹 Wireframing & Prototyping Tools

Before jumping into code, consider designing wireframes to plan layouts.
✅ Figma – Free, collaborative UI/UX design tool
✅ Adobe XD – Good for high-fidelity prototypes
✅ Whimsical – Simple flowchart & wireframing tool
🚀 Next Steps

    Pick a tech stack (React/Next.js + Tailwind + ShadCN).
    Start wireframing in Figma (or I can help with a layout draft).
    Begin coding the Admin Panel UI (base components, authentication, dashboard).
